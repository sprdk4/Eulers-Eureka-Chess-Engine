# Put a list of any additional files in your code here, one per line
# For example, if you have the file "my_code/stuff.cpp"
# You would add the following line to this folder (without the #)
# my_code/stuff.cpp
# If your build fails after adding files, try to build again

# this makes my IDE's code analysis lag significantly, so I've added the files in the CMAKE file instead,
# so cmake doesn't need to do the parsing
# this additional_file.txt feature still works nonetheless, if additional files are desirable to be add
